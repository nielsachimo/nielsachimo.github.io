		<p class="instructions-description">Hey guys, and welcome to <span class="red">R</span>ock <span class="red">P</span>aper <span class="red">S</span>cissors or simply <span class="red">RPS</span>. If this is your first time playing don't worry, the game is very simple and I'll guide you through the process.</p>
		<p class="instructions-description"><span class="red">RPS</span> is like a war game, and to fight it you have to choose 1 of 3 weapons (this is kind of a silly analogy, but most people understand it better this way). Each weapon has it's own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
		<br>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<strong><p class="blue instructions-description">Rock</p></strong>
				<p class="instructions-description">It's a great weapon to use against <span class="blue">scissor</span> because you can usually smash and literally destroy the <span class="blue">scissor</span>, but when it finds <span class="blue">paper</span> it tends to be very weak because the <span class="blue">paper</span> is used to wrap the <span class="blue">rock</span> and eliminate it's destructive powers.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<strong><p class="blue instructions-description">Paper</p></strong>
				<p class="instructions-description">It's great against <span class="blue">rock</span> because it wraps it makes the <span class="blue">rock</span> useless, but a bad weapon to use against <span class="blue">scissor</span>. Why? Because it can literally cut the <span class="blue">paper</span> into pieces.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<strong><p class="blue instructions-description">Scissor</p></strong>
				<p class="instructions-description">Great weapon against <span class="blue">paper</span>, it really makes <span class="blue">paper</span> look like garbash<!--see if garbash is written correctly-->, but <span class="blue">scissor</span> fails miserably against <span class="blue">rock</span> as it gets completely destroyed.</p>

		<p class="instructions-description">When you start the game, you'll have to choose how many games you want to play. This is mainly all there is to it, as I told you at first, it's a very simple game!</p>
		<p class="instructions-description"> If this wasn't enough to make you understand try playing a few games, I'm sure you'll get the grasp of it!
